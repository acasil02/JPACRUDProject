# JPACRUDProject Spending Tracker

#Overview
This project is about a tracker that is suppose to help you keep track of your spendings along with adding, deleting, updating, and being able to read all of your data that has been inputed. The first step was to build the database in MySQL and creating a Spring Data to manipulate the database entity.

#Lessons Learned
I learned how to implement a full CRUD with a Spring Data JPA. This was so that i could be able to retrieve data, add, update, delete, and read from the database.
